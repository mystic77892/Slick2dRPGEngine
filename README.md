================

The current project goal is to refactor everything currently in use and remove nonfunctional elements. The next step before moving on with the major classes
is to create binary file formats for the various data and with them a unified editor, moving away fromm TileD as the map editor and file format as well.
The editor is a separate git repository to be made shortly.
